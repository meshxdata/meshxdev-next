Getting started with NEOS

NEOS is a federated data platform that delivers seamless data interoperability for the cognitive city. Designed and built specifically for Neom, NEOS integrates with a myriad of systems and applications to ensure trusted, governed access to data for sectors, regions, business units, and departments within Neom.

NEOS is based on three pillars:

1. **NEOS Core:** The cloud data platform that provides the underlying data infrastructure, supporting data integration, processing, storage, and sharing capabilities. NEOS Core is designed to handle both batch and real-time data processing, ensuring that data flows efficiently across different sectors and applications.
1. **NEOS Exchange:** The centralized data exchange that enables sectors to discover, consume, share, and exchange data securely and reliably. NEOS Exchange supports a marketplace model where data products can be catalogued, exchanged, or monetized, fostering an ecosystem of data-driven applications and services.
1. **NEOS Mesh:** The overall data mesh of interconnected data domains in Neom, with federated computational governance, policies, and regulatory compliance in place (e.g. data sovereignty, autonomy in data handling and harmony in data sharing).
