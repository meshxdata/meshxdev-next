## What is Data Mesh?

Data mesh is a paradigm shift in data architecture, moving away from monolithic data warehouses and lakes towards a decentralized, domain-oriented approach. It treats data as a product, managed by cross-functional teams who own their data pipelines end-to-end. This model enhances scalability, accelerates innovation, and improves data quality and governance.
